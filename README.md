# UAV_LTL_Project
Mission Planning using Linear Temporal Logic

We present several test cases for motion and mission planning for UAVs. 
Our goal is to determine task specifications that can capture complex UAV behaviors. 
These tasks can be reactive in nature to the environment in which the UAV operates.
