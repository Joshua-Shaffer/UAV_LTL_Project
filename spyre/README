Summary

    SPyRE is an OpenGL retained-mode rendering engine.  It depends only 
    on Pygame, PyOpenGL, and Python, so should work well on a wide 
    range of platforms.
   
	A variety of demos are included, including various particle models.
	
	A test suite is also provided, though its 400+ tests still fall 
	well short of comprehensive.
	
Getting the software

    The software is available as a zipfile here:
	http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=110483

    The official URL for this Web site is
    http://pduel.sourceforge.net/projects/


Requirements

    - A functioning "OpenGL", http://www.opengl.org/ system.  Those
      who do not have any special OpenGL-supporting hardware can
      install "MesaGL", http://www.mesa3d.org/.

    - "PyOpenGL 2.x", http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/ or greater.

	- "Pygame 1.6" or greater, http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml


Overview

	See the included README_ZOE file for Erik Max Francis's description of the 
	functionality.  SPyRE has the same functionality, with exceptions 
	mentioned above.  It has added functionality addressing such features as 
	lighting, perspective, and depth cueing.
